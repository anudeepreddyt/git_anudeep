**diceRoller/

A simple web-based dice roller built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can choose how many dice to roll (1–6), and the app generates random results, displaying both the numeric values and matching dice icons. Includes a reset option and interactive UI.

---

**randomPass/

This project generates a unique and semi-random password based on user input. The user provides their first name, last name, and date of birth. The script extracts specific characters, validates that names do not contain numbers, generates random special characters, and alternates them with the processed string to create a structured yet unpredictable password. The final password is displayed in bold for better visibility. This approach makes the password more secure than a simple user-based pattern.

**clock/

This project is a simple and responsive digital clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It displays the current time in a 12-hour format with AM/PM, updating every second using setInterval().
The clock is centered on the page with a custom background for a clean and modern UI.

**stopwatch/

A simple and responsive stopwatch built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Features include start, stop (pause), resume, and reset functionality with accurate time tracking (hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds).

---

**calculator/

This calculator uses JavaScript functions and event listeners to handle user input and evaluate expressions. The display is an <input> field updated through three main functions: appendToDisplay(input) adds numbers or operators to the display, clearDisplay() resets the display, and calculate() evaluates the current expression using eval() and shows the result. All calculator buttons are handled through a single loop. Each button triggers an action based on its value: if the button value is "=", the expression is evaluated; otherwise, the button’s value is appended to the display.

---

**rcs/

A simple and interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.Players can choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer generates a random choice.The game displays both selections and shows whether the player wins, loses, or ties.Includes a Reset button to clear the results and play again.

**weatherApp/

A simple and clean weather app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can enter any city name to instantly see the city, temperature (°C), weather condition, and humidity. The app fetches live data from the OpenWeather API and displays it using dynamic DOM elements. If an invalid city is entered, a clear error message appears. Lightweight, beginner-friendly, and great for learning API integration.
