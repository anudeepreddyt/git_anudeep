**diceRoller/

A simple web-based dice roller built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can choose how many dice to roll (1–6), and the app generates random results, displaying both the numeric values and matching dice icons. Includes a reset option and interactive UI.

---

**randomPass/

This project generates a unique and semi-random password based on user input. The user provides their first name, last name, and date of birth. The script extracts specific characters, validates that names do not contain numbers, generates random special characters, and alternates them with the processed string to create a structured yet unpredictable password. The final password is displayed in bold for better visibility. This approach makes the password more secure than a simple user-based pattern.

**clock/

This project is a simple and responsive digital clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It displays the current time in a 12-hour format with AM/PM, updating every second using setInterval().
The clock is centered on the page with a custom background for a clean and modern UI.

**stopwatch/

A simple and responsive stopwatch built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Features include start, stop (pause), resume, and reset functionality with accurate time tracking (hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds).
